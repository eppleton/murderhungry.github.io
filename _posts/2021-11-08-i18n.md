Hello to our first Update (Yay!). When we started developing the app, it was meant for a private murder mystery dinner party. So all the texts were German. So the logical next step was to make the UI available in different languages. Starting today all login and signup screens as well as the menus are available in English and German with other languages to follow. 

As always you can check out the current version of the app here:


[Ta-da!](/preview/)

The next step will be to also internationalize the stories themselves, so you can play them in your language of choice. One thing we would be interested to hear from you: Would you want to be able to switch the language in the app, or is it OK if the app picks up the language from the phone/browser settings? The latter is what we currently do.
