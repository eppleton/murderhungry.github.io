So here we are, an empty document staring at me, waiting to be filled with exiting and engaging info about my latest endeavour. I'm a bit nervous and don't know exactly how to kick this off. OK, no overthinking, let's just start. 

This is the "Murderhungry Blog", an experiment to deveop a project in the open, find out if it's worth my and your time, get early feedback, build fast and hopefully succeed or otherwise - at least - fail fast.


The posts are about "Murderhungry", an app and tools for organizing and hosting murder mystery parties. The idea started when I decided to write my own murder mystery dinner party advernture for my wife's birthday. We love hosting murder mystery parties. The costumes, the decorations, the cooking, the fun of playing an interesting character with dark secrets and the excitement of trying to figure out who is the murderer. 

But I never liked the process of organizing the event the traditional way. First you have to make sure that each potential player has time and likes to play. Then you send out printed invitations by snail mail. And finally you need to make sure everbody brings their booklet at the night of the event, and nobody reads ahead. And it's even worse when you write the story yourself. You need to layout a booklet for each role and print it and cut it and fold it...


This would be so much easier with an app. The app could send and track invitations, no need to send out booklets and invitations via regular mail. It's easy to forget a booklet, but we're conditioned to never forget our smartphone, so you won't have to print booklets when your guests are already in the house. You can control when it's time to start the next round, and nobody can "accidentially" read more information than they should. 


And for writers, the app will layout and paginate the texts. Also there are many additional things you can do with an app, for example it can receive fake voice mails, texts or video messages to make the game more immersive. And there's many more little ideas, gadgets and surprises I would like to discuss with you here.


In the coming weeks, I'll build a [minimum viable product (MVP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) and document my progress here. I'll post some messages on relevant subs on [Reddit](https://reddit.com) and other sites to invite potential users to give me feedback through comments. My main indicator if this is something that will go beyond the "MVP" stage will be engagement. The number of people that sign up for updates, comment and discuss will be my indicator.


I'm doing it this way because I often spent a lot of time building something (for example an app) the way I thought people would like to use it, only to find out that I missed an important aspect. I always knew that it's better to get early feedback, talk to users, test and reiterate. But it's difficult to leave your comfort zone, and it's convenient to pretend to know what users want. 

And my main excuse would be that users don't really know what they want until you show it to them. But I always knew, that the right way to deal with that would be to start with something crude and let the intended users decide if they liked it and tell me what is missing. 

And that's it, that's why I'm here eager to get your feedback on "Murderhungry". Is it worth my time and yours? Is it something that would help you organize and host a murder mystery party, or even write one yourself?
