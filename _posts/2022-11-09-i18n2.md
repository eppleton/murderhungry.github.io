Progress! We're happy to announce that we've reached our next milestone. In the latest version of the app, the stories are multilingual. So when you load an adventure, the app checks for your language and chooses the right translation  of you. If there's no localized version available, the app falls back to English. 

As always you can check out the current version of the app here:

Our plan is to translate adventures from other countries. We're really excited about that. I recently checked out some American murder mystery party sets and the stories are completely different from the games we play in Germany. Here in Germany most stories are variations of Agatha Christie novels. Don't get me wrong, I like the classics, but it gets boring when you're invited to the third variation of "Murder on the Orient Express" ;-). I'm really eager to check out crazy stories with aliens and time travellers.
